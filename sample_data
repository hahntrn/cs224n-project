        {"context": "If you are a traditional traveller who believes cameras are irreplaceable,here are some things you should pay attention to when looking for the perfect camera. Sensor size Along with the megapixel count,the size of the sensor dictates the general image quality as well as the camera's performance in low light. It also determines whether the camera can electronically put the details it captures bigger enough to see--which is what makes the pictures not clear enough to see when you view the photos on a bigger screen. Portability \"The important thing is that the camera isn't too big or heavy,and that you have a good zoom range for both wide-angle and telephoto shots ,\"Atherton told CNN.A good choice would be a slim,light pocket camera with a high-qualified built-in optical zoom. \"These are very popular for travel as they are light,but built with a telephoto lens that can zoom up to 60 times,\" Atherton said. Zoom and shutter speed For action or crowd shots,a fast shutter speed is a key factor. \"When dealing with anything that's active--wildlife or people in action on the street--faces change within a tiny part of a second,\" said Arnold,\"a fast shutter speed is helpful in shooting the several hundred photos you might need to get that single winning shot.\"",

Several days ago, I tried entering a lift with one of my arms fixed in a bandage while carrying a computer bag in the other. Not being fast enough, I was passed by two young people who managed to get into the lift before me. The lift door closed only after I entered. Having already pressed their wanted floor button, the young people waited impatiently for me to press the button for where I was going. If they had decided to help, we could have moved much faster. But they had not. So I did my best and pressed the button with my arm. The two young people looked very angry with me. I was losing heart. The memory of this incident has stayed with me because it followed shortly after my building's watchman refused to help me carry a heavy box full of books. His answer was that he could not carry the books a few meters because it was not his job. However, I remembered myself helping people for so many years carrying boxes, shopping bags, or pushing wheelchairs upon the request of a stranger in need or when my conscience called on me. \"Oh, this young generation, they have no manners, \"my grandmother would say. The idea of good manners refers to the considering of other people's feelings. We need more and more people to have good manners. Good manners should be-come part of our lives.", "qas": [{"question": "How did the two young people feel when the author pressed the button?", "id": "0f52ba11790d4329a176dab862cf963d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 663, "text": "angry"}]}]}]},
